Trigger Word Detection

In this notebook we are experimenting with the following techniques and technologies:

1. Audio data handling
2. Spectographs
3. Using spectographs as feed for RNNs
4. GRU and RNNs dual layer architecture
5. Synthetizing audio training data
6. Long training
7. Overlaying audio streams
8. Predicting trigger words among word-negatives on top of different backgrounds
